    confidence: 96,
    status: "infected",
    modelUsed: "ViT + Swin Ensemble",
    description:
      "Early blight is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani. It produces dark, concentric spots on older leaves, which eventually yellow and drop. The disease can also affect stems and fruit.",
    cure: "Apply fungicides such as chlorothalonil or copper-based sprays. Remove and destroy infected plant debris.",
    prevention:
      "Avoid overhead watering and maintain good air circulation. Rotate crops and use disease-resistant varieties.",
    careTips:
      "Remove infected leaves promptly. Maintain proper soil nutrition with balanced fertilizer. Mulch around plants to prevent soil splash.",

    status: "critical",
    modelUsed: "ViT + Swin Ensemble",
    description:
      "Late blight, caused by Phytophthora infestans, creates water-soaked lesions that rapidly enlarge and turn brown-black. White mold may appear on leaf undersides in humid conditions.",
    cure: "Apply systemic fungicides containing mefenoxam or chlorothalonil immediately. Remove and destroy all infected plant material.",
    prevention:
      "Plant certified disease-free seed potatoes. Ensure adequate spacing for airflow. Avoid irrigation late in the day.",
    careTips:
      "Monitor weather conditions closely—cool, wet weather promotes spread. Hill soil around plants to protect tubers from spore wash.",

    status: "infected",
    modelUsed: "Swin",
    description:
      "Apple scab is caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis. It creates olive-green to black lesions on leaves and fruit, leading to premature leaf drop and unmarketable fruit.",
    cure: "Apply fungicide sprays (captan or myclobutanil) beginning at green tip stage through petal fall.",
    prevention:
      "Rake and destroy fallen leaves in autumn. Plant scab-resistant varieties. Prune trees to improve air circulation.",

    status: "infected",
    modelUsed: "ViT",
    description:
      "Black rot, caused by Guignardia bidwellii, produces reddish-brown leaf spots and causes berries to shrivel into hard, black mummies.",
    cure: "Apply fungicides (mancozeb or myclobutanil) from bud break through four weeks after bloom.",
    prevention:
      "Remove mummified berries and infected canes during dormant pruning. Maintain open canopy for air circulation.",

    modelUsed: "ViT + Swin Ensemble",
    description:
      "Caused by Exserohilum turcicum, this disease creates long, cigar-shaped grayish-green lesions on corn leaves, reducing photosynthetic area and yield.",
    cure: "Apply foliar fungicides containing azoxystrobin or propiconazole at disease onset.",
    prevention:
      "Plant resistant hybrids. Practice crop rotation with non-host crops. Till infected residue after harvest.",
    careTips:
      "Scout fields regularly beginning at V8 growth stage. Ensure adequate plant nutrition to support disease tolerance.",

    description:
      "Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, produces diamond-shaped lesions with gray centers on leaves and can destroy entire panicles before harvest.",
    cure: "Apply tricyclazole or isoprothiolane fungicides. Drain fields for 3–5 days during susceptible growth stages.",
    prevention:
      "Use blast-resistant varieties. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization. Maintain proper water management.",

    description:
      "Stripe rust (yellow rust) is caused by Puccinia striiformis and forms bright yellow-orange pustules in stripes along wheat leaves.",
    cure: "Apply propiconazole or tebuconazole fungicides at first sign of infection.",
    prevention:
      "Grow resistant varieties. Early sowing often reduces risk. Monitor neighboring fields for rust outbreaks.",
    careTips:
      "Scout fields from tillering onward. Avoid dense plantings that trap humidity around leaves.",
